# Contributing

SCMBAT is an open source project. There are many ways to contribute to it, from writing documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into it. We would also love to hear how you are using SCMBAT. 

### Bug reports
If you think you have found a bug in SCMBAT, first make sure that you are testing against the master branch - your issue may already have been fixed. If not, search our issues list on GitHub in case a similar issue has already been opened.

Please provide adequate information for the reproduction of the bug you have found. Provide as much information as you can so that it can be analyzed and solved faster. 

### Feature requests
You can recommend new features to SCMBAT. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work. 

### Contributing code and documentation changes
If you have a fix for a bug or a new feature that you would like to contribute to SCMBAT, please find or open an issue about it first. Talk about what you would like to do. It may be that somebody is already working on it, or that there are particular issues that you should know about before implementing the change.

To proceed with a code contribution, follow these guidelines:

- Fork and clone the repository. You will need to fork the main SCMBAT repository and clone it to your local machine. See github help page for help https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo

- Push your local changes to your forked copy of the repository and submit a pull request (https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests ). In the pull request, describe what your changes do and mention the number of the issue (bug or feature) that it addresses.

- There will probably be discussion about the pull request and, if any changes are needed, they will be worked on collaboratively until your pull request can be merged into SCMBAT
